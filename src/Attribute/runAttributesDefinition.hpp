If there are few points in the barrier, this parameter has no effect. \n  \n . If POLL_CENTER_USE_CACHE is false, this parameter has no effect. \n  \n . If there are many points in the barrier, this parameter limits \n   the number of iterations generated. \n   A mixture of feasible and infeasible points of the barrier is used to \n   generate iterations. \n   Each iteration uses a point of the barrier as frame center.  \n  \n .
